Liverpool Homeopathy, the fifth BHA supported clinic in the UK, is set to launch on April 24th and will be operated in partnership with the North West Friends of Homeopathy. The clinic, at the Liverpool Medical Institution, will be staffed by a team of three highly experienced homeopaths: Dr Hugh Nielsen, Emma McEvoy and Robin Grenfell Cowan and will run on Wednesday mornings.<br><br>Cristal Sumner, the BHA’s chief executive, said: “With the limited availability of homeopathic treatment within the NHS, services like Liverpool Homeopathy are more important than ever. Everyone has the right to choose high-quality healthcare and we’re proud to be able to bring affordable homeopathic treatment to Merseyside.”<br><br>An initial consultation at Liverpool Homeopathy is £20 with follow-up sessions costing £10. For more information and to book an appointment please visit <a href=\"http://www.liverpoolhomeopathy.org/\">the website</a>.<br><br>The BHA opened its first charitable clinic in Norwich in 2011 and now operates services in Bath, York, Norwich and Edinburgh. Additional services will be announced during 2019. Full details of our clinics can be found <a href=\"https://www.britishhomeopathic.org/treatment/bha-clinics/\">here</a>.<br>"
